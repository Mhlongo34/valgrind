## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Raspberry Pi OS (for embedded deployment)
- [Other dependencies]

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-trading robot/RoboProject.git
cd RoboProject

## Key Features

1. **Dual-Path Committing**
   - Clear instructions for both quick commits (`git commit -m`) and descriptive commits (`git commit`)

2. **Commit Template**
   - Ready-to-use example following professional 50/72 rule
   - Includes placeholder for issue referencing

3. **Hardware-Software Integration**
   - Component specification table
   - Architecture diagram using Mermaid syntax

4. **Robotics-Specific Workflow**
   - Sensor data requirements in PR checklist
   - Embedded development considerations

5. **Preconfigured Setup**
   - Copy-paste installation commands
   - Hardware wiring diagram placeholder

## Next Steps After Setup

1. Replace placeholders (`your-username`, `RoboProject`) with your actual details
2. Add real media files to `docs/` directory:
   - `demo.gif` - Robot on action
   - `wiring_diagram.png` - Hardware connections
3. Customize the software architecture diagram
4. Update `requirements.txt` with your Python dependencies
5. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (I can provide a sample workflow if needed)
